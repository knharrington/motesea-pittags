Shiny app for real-time monitoring of PIT tag data in an aquarium setting.

## Current State

The app is not live nor utilizing data from a current experiment. This draft is built on a static dataset resulting from many tagged fishes that were detected by antennas and loops in a natural setting in October 2023. User interface elements regarding both habitats and the fish are arbitrary and were fabricated to demonstrate an example experiment. Files stored in the `data` folder are unavailable for download.
